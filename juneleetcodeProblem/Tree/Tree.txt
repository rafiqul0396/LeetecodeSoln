Tree: is a data structure and non-linear data structure
Root: no parent 
edge:link bt parent and child
Leaf Node: no child
Siblings: children of same parent 
ancestor: a Node p is an ancestor of node  q if there exists a  path from root to q and p 
appears on the paths.the node q is called a descendent of paths.
Level: the set of all nodes at a given  depth is called the Level
Depth: length of the  path from the root to the node
Height:the length of the path from root to deepest nodes in the tree 
Binary tree: if every node has two or one or zero child 
Empty tree is also Binary tree
Full Binary Tree: if  each node have   exactly two children and all leaf  nodes are at the same Level
complete Bnary tree: if all  leaf nodes are  at a Height h or h-1 and without any missing 
number in the sequence

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
the number of nodes n in a full binar tree =2*(h+1)-1
complete Binary Tree: minimum number of  nodes= 2*has
                      max no of nodes =2*h+1  -1

                      leaf nodes in full Binary tree: 2*h
                      n+1 links





# Basic Operations :
            
            1. Inserting an element into a tree;
            2. Deleting an element from a tree.
            3. Searching for an element 
            4.Traversing the tree.


# Auxiliary Operations
               1. Finding the size of the tree
               2. Finding the Height of the tree
               3. Finding the level which has maximum sum
               4.Finding the least commn ancestor for a given pair of nodes and many more
